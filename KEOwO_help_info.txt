-------- the Original Machine

The original Enigma Machine is designed by a German Engineer Arthur Scherbius
The original purpose of the Machine is meant for banks to encrypt/decrypt messages etc.

On the Original machine, they only have a Keyboard, 3 Rotors, 1 Reflector, 1 Lampboard.
Assume we have the diagram below :

| Keyboard  | -> |         | -> |         | -> |         | -> |           |
|           |    | Rotor 1 |    | Rotor 2 |    | Rotor 3 |    | Reflector |
| LampBoard | <- |         | <- |         | <- |         | <- |           |

When a key is pressed on the Keyboard, 
the signal goes through the 1st rotor, 2nd rotor, 3rd rotor, 
then the reflector, and the reflector will send the signal back to the rotors, 
then to the lampBoard, lighting up the encrypted/decrypted result.

A single rotor has 3 parts : Left Side, Middle Blob, Right Side.
Both the Left side and Right side has 26 studs,
the Middle Blob is a total of 26 wires, criss crossing connecting the LeftSide and the RightSide.
Each rotor has different wires connections. 

Every time when a key is pressed the rotor will turn, 
this means that for every character, 
the pairing of the plaintext character and ciphertext character will be different.

i.e. : if you keep pressing AAAAAA......, what you will get is not the same letter, instead it will come out as a pseudo random mess.

note : all rotors can be taken out and rearranged,
note : each rotor can have 26 rotation position,
note : when the 1st rotor done a full rotation, it will kick the 2nd rotor, when the 2nd rotor done a full rotation, it will kick the 3rd rotor.




-------- WWII : the Nazi saw it

During WWII, the Nazi saw the machine and the machine is a perfect fit for message encryption.
But the Nazi decided to beef up the machine to military grade




-------- WWII : Plugboard

| Keyboard  | -> |           | -> |         | -> |         | -> |         | -> |           |
|           |    | Plugboard |    | Rotor 1 |    | Rotor 2 |    | Rotor 3 |    | Reflector |
| LampBoard | -> |           | <- |         | <- |         | <- |         | <- |           |

the plugboard is a board with 26 sockets and 10 wires, each wire has 2 plugs.
in this case you can make 10 pairs from the 26 letters
when the signal goes through the Plugboard, if the letter has a pair, it becomes the new letter, else it stays itself.




-------- WWII : Rotors

sometimes a set of Enigma machine during WWII, 
it consists of 5 rotors (I, II, III, IV, V), or 8 (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII) 
to choose 3 from, sometimes a single machine can accept 4 rotors




-------- the critical FLAW

since the machine is just making 13 pairs from 26 letter for every character, a character is guaranteed to be encrypted to another letter.
i.e. a character can never be encrypted to itself.
with this, a enigma machine ciphertext can be cracked by using "known-plaintext attack"




-------- type-x

the British saw the machine, and decided to beef up the machine
such that sometimes a letter can be encrypted to itself,
and they call it the type-x machine




-------- heh heh heh OwO

in 2014, XR_XharpRazor watched the Enigma machine video from Numberphile, attempted to make a new encryption mechanism
in 2017, the first version of the 64KE machine is online on the M2007U website
in 2018, the second version is online
in 2020, the third version is online

encryption : Keyboard -> Plugboard 1 -> Rotor 4 -> Rotor 3 -> Rotor 2 -> Rotor 1 -> Plugboard 2 -> Lampboard
decryption : Keyboard <- Plugboard 1 <- Rotor 4 <- Rotor 3 <- Rotor 2 <- Rotor 1 <- Plugboard 2 <- Lampboard

in the Family of KE Machines, all rotors can have their wires configured, all plugboards can have a maximum of letterQty/2 pairs
