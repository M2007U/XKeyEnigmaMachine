Commands :

-------- Setting up the Machine

chQty               : set the number of charracters, WARNING : you have to set up your Keyboard, LampBoard, Rotors, PlugBoards based on the number of charracters

KL.sK               : set the set of characters of the plaintext
KL.sL               : set the set of characters of the ciphertext
Rx.sR.v             : x is 1 to 4, v is 'm' or 'r', set the wiring of the 'x'th rotor by using version 'v' where the wiring is 'm : a coma separated integer list from 0 to chQty entered manually' or 'r : randomly generated'
Rx.sK               : x is 1 to 4, set the ring setting / ring offset of the 'x'th rotor
Px.sR.v             : x is 1 or 2, v is 'm' or 'r', set the connections of the 'x'th plugboard by using version 'v' where the connections 'm : is a coma separated integer list from 0 to chQty entered manually' or 'r : randomly connected'

Rx.r                : x is 1 to 4, rotate the 'x'th rotor
RA.sP               : set the positions of all Rotors

-------- Using the machine

KL.p                : print the content of the Keyboard and the LampBoard
Rx.p                : x is 1 to 4, print the wirings of the 'x'th Rotor
RA.p                : print the wirings and the current position of all the Rotors
Px.p                : x is 1 or 2, print the connection of the 'x'th plugboard

key.print           : print the content of the Keyboard, Lampboard, Pugboards and Rotors
key.gen.swap        : generate a shuffled int array by using the swaping method
key.gen.created     : generate a shuffled int array by using the card method

enc.c               : start encryption, characters by characters, when done, type 'done'
enc.s               : start encryption, enter the entire string of plaintext
dec.c               : start decryption, characters by characters, when done, type 'done'
dec.s               : start decryption, enter the entire string of ciphertext

-------- other Commands

clear               : clear the screen
exit                : close KEOwO machine
ld.64               : print some premade 64int arrays
ld.ch               : print some premade sets of charracters
